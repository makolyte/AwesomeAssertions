# A fork of a fork of FluentAssertions controlled by the community

Since that guy tried to monetize FluentAssertions, you can fork the version before he did that and use it just like before. 

This is a fork of the AwesomeAssertions fork, because I want to play around with it. 

## Acknowledgements

This was made possible by the hard work and dedication of the original authors and more than 200 contributors of
FluentAssertions. We are extremely grateful for their efforts.
